PHP5 Word Press Amazon Auto Poster From Comment Posts

This was made to use "spam" posts as a "trigger" to launch amazon auto posting, to populate the wordpress posts, was spawned off the Amazon Auto Poster wp-plugin.

What this does is, when there is a POST request made to the 'wp-comments-post.php' script, this script will simply use that as an 'event' to fire off the Amazon Auto Poster.  Currently it is using a Newegg RSS Feed that gets randomly chosen from their site, it grabs a new product keyword, then searches on Amazon for it.  After finding a result, it performs the Amazon Auto Post into Word Press database.

You must have a wp user setup with XML RPC rights enabled.
